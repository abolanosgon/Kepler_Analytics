This project simulates a real marketing dataset and demonstrates how to **clean, transform, analyze, and visualize** data using only Excel — replicating the type of work done in marketing analytics roles.

## 🧹 Transform — Data Cleaning and Preparation

Performed in `clean_data.xlsx`:
- Removed duplicates and blank rows
- Normalized campaign and platform names (uppercase, no extra spaces)
- Checked and corrected data types:
  - Dates → date format  
  - IDs and names → text  
  - Impressions, clicks, conversions → numbers  
  - Spend and revenue → currency
- Created calculated KPI columns:
  - CTR = Clicks / Impressions  
  - CVR = Conversions / Clicks  
  - CPC = Spend / Clicks  
  - CPA = Spend / Conversions  
  - ROI = (Revenue - Spend) / Spend
- Created a conditional column using IF to classify campaigns as **“Profitable”** or **“Not profitable”**

## 📊 Load / Analyze — PivotTables and Charts

Created multiple PivotTables to analyze performance by:
- Platform
- Campaign objective
- Campaign name
- Daily trends (date)
- Profitability status

Then built an interactive dashboard including:
- KPI cards (CTR, CPC, CPA, ROI)
- Daily Spend vs Conversions (line + column combo chart)
- Impressions vs CTR (column + line combo chart)
- ROI by Platform (bar chart)
- CPA by Objective (column chart)
- Profitability breakdown (pie chart)
- Connected slicers for platform, objective, campaign_name
- Connected timeline filter for dates
